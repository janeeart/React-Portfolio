                    <p>I'm an arts and culture enthusiast turned front-end web developer with a passion for collaborating with others to create accessible and interactive experiences for people of diverse communities. I hold a certificate from the University of Denver in full stack web technologies, including JavaScript, Git, and MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. I've gained intercultural competence and practiced inclusive engagement through my international and domestic work experiences. I recently worked on a team of four to develop an app that allows users to search for information on their favorite music artists, including the artistsâ€™ upcoming events and their biography. I am excited to leverage my skills and background to build improved web experiences for all users.</p>
