                    <p>I'm an arts and culture enthusiast turned front-end web developer with a passion for collaborating with others to create accessible and interactive experiences for people of diverse communities. I hold a certificate from the University of Denver in full stack web technologies, including JavaScript, Git, and MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. I've gained intercultural competence and practiced inclusive engagement through my international and domestic work experiences. I recently collaborated with the owner of Tailors Union, LLC to enhance the visual appeal of the company's WordPress and Wix sites in order to make an impact on the company's online presence. I am excited to leverage my skills and background to build improved web experiences for all users.</p>
