                    <p>I'm an arts and culture enthusiast turned coder and I will soon hold a certificate in full stack web technologies from the University of Denverâ€™s coding bootcamp. I am passionate about collaborating with others to develop meaningful web applications for users of diverse backgrounds and I'm excited to leverage my skills to build improved web experiences for all users.
